This repository contains a Python script for web scraping BNI (Business Network International) member details using Selenium. The script is designed to extract information from the BNI website and organize it into a CSV file based on the specified region names.

## Prerequisites

Before running the script, make sure you have the following installed:

- Python 3
- Selenium
- ChromeDriver (for Chrome browser) or GeckoDriver (for Firefox browser)
- Google Chrome or Mozilla Firefox browser

Install the required Python libraries using:

```bash
pip install selenium
```

Download the appropriate web driver for your browser and set the path in the script.

## Usage

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/webscraping-bni-members.git
cd webscraping-bni-members
```

2. Edit the `regions.csv` file with the specific region names under the "region_name" column.

3. Run the script:

```bash
python scrape_bni_members.py
```

The script will launch a browser, navigate to the BNI website, and start scraping member details for each specified region. The information will be saved in a CSV file named `bni_member_details.csv`.
